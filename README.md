# Reminder-Pro

Single-page web app for creating and managing reminders with timestamp labels.

### Try it out
Here's a link of the deployment on gh-pages [live preview](https://bewpage.github.io/reminder-pro/)

### Stack
> **React**  (bootstrapped with **create-react-app**)  
> **Redux**  
> **MomentJS**  
> **react-bootstrap**  
> **sfcookies** 

### I extended this application with:
- Cookies - application keeps a local history of data on a browser (next step to use database).
- Add alert messages to the application if the current date passes the due date for a reminder - now old reminders have red border.
- All entries are displayed in date order.
- >Host the application on a database so multiple users can interact with the same reminders - not yet done.
